pg_hashids, generate short unique ids from integers
=========================================

Hashids is a small open-source library that generates short, unique, non-sequential ids from numbers.
It converts numbers like 347 into strings like “yr8”.
You can also decode those ids back. This is useful in bundling several parameters into one or simply using them as short UIDs.

You can use hashids to hide primary keys in your database. I've used the extension on several production databases. 

Tested PostgreSQL versions : 9.5.X and 9.6.X (Should work on older versions, just not tested)

It's using [hashids.c](https://github.com/tzvetkoff/hashids.c) under the hood. More information about hashids and it's implementations here: [hashids.org](http://hashids.org)

Installation
============

Make sure you have development packages installed for postgres and
build tools in general.

```bash
$ USE_PGXS=1 make install
```

Then in a psql session issue:

```sql
CREATE extension pg_hashids;
```

Update
============

Install as usual.

```bash
$ USE_PGXS=1 make install
```

Then in a psql session issue:

```sql
ALTER EXTENSION pg_hashids UPDATE;
```
    
or

```sql
DROP EXTENSION pg_hashids;
CREATE EXTENSION pg_hashids;
```
    
Check

```sql
SELECT default_version, installed_version FROM pg_available_extensions WHERE name = 'pg_hashids';
```

Tests
============

```bash
$ USE_PGXS=1 make installcheck
```

Usage
============
#### Encoding
Returns a hash using the default `alphabet` and empty `salt`.

```sql
SELECT id_encode(1001); -- Result: jNl
```

Returns a hash using the default `alphabet` and supplied `salt`.

```sql
SELECT id_encode(1234567, 'This is my salt'); -- Result: Pdzxp
```

Returns a hash using the default `alphabet`, `salt` and minimum hash length.

```sql
SELECT id_encode(1234567, 'This is my salt', 10); -- Result: PlRPdzxpR7
```
	

Returns a hash using the supplied `alphabet`, `salt` and minimum hash length.

```sql
SELECT id_encode(1234567, 'This is my salt', 10, 'abcdefghijABCDxFGHIJ1234567890'); -- Result: 3GJ956J9B9
```

#### Decoding
You can also decode previously generated hashes. Just use the same `salt`, otherwise you'll get wrong results.

```sql
SELECT id_decode('PlRPdzxpR7', 'This is my salt', 10); -- Result: 1234567
```
	
Using a custom alphabet

```sql
SELECT id_decode('3GJ956J9B9', 'This is my salt', 10, 'abcdefghijABCDxFGHIJ1234567890'); -- Result: 1234567
```
